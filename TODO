* remove need for http server for preseed. --initrd-inject is the key!
    see http://honk.sigxcpu.org/con/Preseeding_Debian_virtual_machines_with_virt_install.html
* add dependencies to debian control file
* move salting scripts to files
* move default template to file?
* add support for image files, now only lvm is supported
* add support for lxc!
* do even more error checking

---

* maybe reimplement this with perl/ruby/python. bash is so clumsy...
